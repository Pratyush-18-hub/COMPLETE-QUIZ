# 📚 Proof-of-Blockchain Knowledge (PoK-NFT)

## 📝 Project Title
**Proof-of-Blockchain Knowledge – Soulbound NFT Badge Minting via Smart Quiz Results**

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a Clarity-based Web3 application where users **submit quiz scores** and, upon meeting a minimum threshold, can **mint a soulbound NFT** as proof of their blockchain knowledge. It acts as a **verifiable learning credential** stored on the Stacks blockchain.

Users who complete quizzes off-chain and submit their score on-chain can prove their educational achievements through **non-transferable NFTs** representing their skills.

## 🌟 Project Vision
We envision a **decentralized credential system** where educational accomplishments are:
- **Immutable** and **verifiable** on-chain
- **Non-transferable**, tied to an individual's identity
- Usable across platforms, DAOs, and job applications for skill-based filtering

It serves as a foundational tool for **Web3 learning communities**, bootcamps, and self-paced educational apps.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- On-chain **quiz generation & validation logic**
- Integration with **React frontend** + Hiro Wallet
- **Soulbound NFT standard extension** (non-transferable enforcement)
- Support for **multiple subjects & badge levels**
- On-chain **GPA tracker** based on quizzes from different topics
